# Purely Functional Solutions of LeetCode Problems

I wonder if there exists some methods to solve the algorithm problems of LeetCode in pure functional way. As a result, I create this project. I use a lot of purely functional data structures described in *Chris Okasaki's Purely Functional Data Structures.* If someone wants to see the detailed implementation, please refer to the `libs` directory.

To see how to use the libs, please check the tests parts in each file.

Each solution file contains some tests, which is not a part of the solution.

I'm a newbie of the `racket` programming language. So any suggestion and PR are welcomed.
